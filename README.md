Instagram is **AWFUL** at its main job - posting images

Imagine not being able to post both portrait and landscape images in the same post

This was made to resize images in a **google drive** folder to fit Instagram's square post resolution
by automatically superimposing images in `raws` and putting the resulting images in `edited`
